# Park Picker
### An app for exploring our National Parks.

*By David Codner, Preston Hill, Michael Gostomski, Penny Leung and Chiemeka Anunkor*

## Description
This full stack web app boasts a fully hosted backend, and database. The backend is hosted on Heroku, and the database is hosted by MongoDB Atlas. The webpage utilizes a React front end, Axios API calls, fully integrated user login and signup with options to save results when logged in. See our list of technologies used for more details. 

## Usage
Enter a location and select an activity (camping, hiking, swimming, etc...) to view the closest parks where that activity is available. After searching, the 10 closest National Parks where the chosen activity is available are displayed. Click on the resulting park cards to view more information, including a driving route, park details and forecast. Link to the deployed app on heroku.
